to make onigiri you need

- sticky rice (cooked in a rice cooker)
- salt
- filling of your choice (tinned tuna, cooked salmon, pickled plum)

take a hand-sized portion of rice, and pack it down.
Create a dimple within the rice, and add a small spoonful of filling
add another handful of rice and use your hands to compress the rice, creating a rough triangle shape

OPTIONAL: use a sheet of nori to wrap the rice ball
